		<h3>Welcome to Mahitahi</h3>
		<h4>Heading towards the first truly decentralized P2P-Insurance</h4>

		<p>Mahitahi is the maori word for collaboration. This name fits neatly because this shall be a place to collaborate on the first truly decentralized Peer-to-Peer insurance on the blockchain.</p>
		
		<h3>The first truly decentralized Peer-to-Peer-Insurance on the blockchain</h3>
		<p>Along with the emerging sharing economy, several attempts have been made to establish Peer-to-Peer Insurance companies. Alas, the word "Peer-to-Peer Company" bears a contradiction in it self, because it introduces a centralized element - a company - in a model which should eliminate centralized entities. </p>
		<p>But how could a truly decentralized Peer-to-Peer insurance look like?</p>
		<p>In the last months we have developed a thorough concept for such a structure - we avoid the word "company" because there won't be any - and we are asking for participants willing to engage in our project.</p>
		<h3>Project objective</h3>
		<p>To develop a complex system like an insurance, on an innovative plattform like the ethereum blockchain we will need a clear and focused concept, a devoted team and of course a budget to finance the developement.</p>
		<p>The recent events have shown that many investors are seeking investment opportunities for decentralized applications and enterprises. Therefore, we will seek a funding via a to-be-defined decentralized organization.</p>
		<p>For a fresh start, we will share some concept papers and a first decent prototype based on <a href="www.myetherwallet.com">www.myetherwallet.com</a>.</p>
